# diabetes-mlops-pipeline
This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) for data and model versioning, and MLflow for experiment tracking. The pipeline focuses on training a Random Forest Classifier on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, with clear stages for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
